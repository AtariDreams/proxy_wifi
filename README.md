# Proxy_wifi

This project enables proxying the Wi-Fi functionnality from a Windows host machine to a VM.

It allows the VM to:
- schedule scans and access the Wi-Fi networks visible by the host
- request connections and disconnections to WPA2PSK and Open networks that will be honored by the host
- request connections to any Wi-Fi network the host is currently connected to ("connection mirroring")
- be notified in case of disconnection and signal quality changes

Networks can be also emulated by proxy_wifi, letting a VM connect to a fake Wi-Fi network.

## VM driver

This repository contains only the Windows host component. A driver must run on the VM and communicate with the host component.
Such a driver has currently been implemented from Linux only, under the name of `proxy_wifi`.

## Building

Requirements:

* cmake >= 3.20 (`choco install -u cmake`)
* [Windows SDK 19041+](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-10-sdk/)
* [Build Tools for Visual Studio 2019+](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2019)

The project generates a MSBuild project and solution for each target. These can be used directly by MSBuild tools, Microsoft Visual Studio, or with CMake directly. There are two targets defined:

1) proxy-wifi: This is a static library containing the core logic.
2) proxy-wifi-cmdline: This is a commandline utility allowing to test the proxy_wifi for basic scenarios.

### Step 1: Configure the project

In the project root:

```Shell
md build && cd build
cmake ..
```

Note that the build type is set to `DEBUG` by default. Make sure to set the `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable appropriately for the desired build flavor. For example, to create a release configuration:

```Shell
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ..
```

### Step 2: Build the project

#### With CMake

```Shell
cmake --build ..
```

#### With Visual Studio

Open `proxy-wifi.sln` which contains a project for each build target:

* `proxy-wifi`
* `proxy-wifi-cmdline`
* `ALL_BUILD`
* `INSTALL`
* `PACKAGE`

#### With Visual Studio Build Tools

Point `msbuild.exe` to the project to build:

```Shell
msbuild.exe proxy-wifi.vcxproj
```

### Step 3: Run unit tests

#### Using the test executable

```Shell
.\test\Debug\proxy-wifi-test.exe
```

#### With CTest

```Shell
cmake --build ..
```

## Basic usage

The public interface of Proxy_wifi is present in [`ProxyWifiService.hpp`](include/ProxyWifi/ProxyWifiService.hpp). It lets client build a `ProxyWifiService` object through the function `BuildProxyWifiService`.
This functions allows to configure the transport layer and to register to Proxy_wifi notifications.

You can additionnaly setup a logger to chose where logs will be output.

```cpp
    // Tell the ProxyWifiService to output logs to a tracelogging provider
    Log::AddLogger(std::make_unique<Log::TraceLoggingLogger>());

    class MyObserver: public ProxyWifiObserver
    {
        void OnGuestConnectionRequest(OperationType type, const DOT11_SSID& ssid) noexcept override
        {
            std::cout << "The guest requested a connection" << std::endl;
        }
    };

    // Must be kept alive until the proxy is destroyed
    auto observer = MyObserver{};

    // Callback providing a list of networks that will be simulated by the Wi-Fi proxy
    auto provideFakeNetworks = [this]() -> std::vector<WifiNetworkInfo> { return ... };

    auto wifiProxy = BuildProxyWifiService(
        ProxyWifiHyperVSettings{vmId},
        std::move(provideFakeNetworks),
        &observer);
    wifiProxy->Start();
```

## Architecture

Proxy_wifi is composed of two main layers: the transport ([Transport.hpp](lib/Transport.hpp)) and the operation handler ([OperationHandler.hpp](lib/OperationHandler.hpp)).
Implementations of `ProxyWifiService` initialize these two layers.
The transport is responsible of communications with the proxy_wifi driver on the guest VM, while the operation handler interact with the Windows Wlan API to honor these requests.

### The transport layer

The transport layer communicate with the guest proxy_wifi driver over two channels:

- a request channel handles commands from the proxy_wifi driver and their response. These exchanges are synchronous, only one command is processed at a time.
- a notification channel handles spontaneous notification from the host, such as network disconnection and signal quality changes.

The transport layers deals with `Message` ([Messages.hpp](lib/Messages.hpp)) and isn't aware of their content or structure beside the header/body structure.

Two implementations of the transport layers are available: over HV sockets or over TCP sockets.
Only the HV socket implementation is supported by the current proxy_wifi driver on the guest. The TCP implementation is mostly available for testing.

### The operation handler

The operation handler handle request received by the transport and produce answer and notifications.

It uses typed requests and responses, parsed from the `Messages` used by the transport ([`Messages.hpp`](lib/Messages.hpp)).
Request and notifications processing is serialized through a work queue.

The operation handler maintain a list of `WlanInterface` ([WlanInterface.hpp](lib/WlanInterface.hpp)) that represent actual Wi-Fi interfaces on the host or fake interfaces to simulate networks.
It dispatches requests to interfaces and aggregate the results as necessary to build messages that the transport layer can send.

In particular:

- "Scan" operations are ran on all available interfaces, and the scan results are aggregated
- "Connect" operations are ran successively on each interface until one succeeds

Each interface handles the command depending on its concrete implementation, using simulated data or fowarding the operation through the host Wlan API.

## Capacity and limitations

Proxy_wifi currently fully support connections from the guest to only WPA2PSK and Open networks.
This is due to Linux allowing only these two authentication algorithms to be offloaded to the driver.

In addition, Proxy_wifi allows the guest VM to "mirror" a connection on the host, for any network type.
Since the host is already connected, no authentication is actually needed, which make the operation straighforward.
However, in order to allow this, the authentication algorithm for any non-supported network is faked in scan results and showed as WPA2-PSK.
